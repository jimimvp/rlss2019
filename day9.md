# Multi-agent Marc Lanctot

Centralised vs. decentralised multi-agent RL
Decentralised - limited communication between agents

Centralised training for decentralised execution - most common case. Training time algorithm knows what the other is doing. Execution time is different.

## Foundations and background
Skoham and Leyton-Brown

Joint policy of players, problem is that we do not have access to other policies -> difference to reinforcement learning

Nash equilibrium is a joint policy such that no player has incentive to deviate

PPAD complete Nash equilibrium.
Nash assumes knowledge, rationality assumption

The Minimax theorem, nothing worth doing untill I prove this (von Neumann)

Nash equilibrium only optimal for two player zero-sum.


Simultaneous moves games, Markov games

Exploitability descent, better than tabular methods.
